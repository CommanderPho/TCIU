Description: Provide user with a clearer way to see all functions used inside the TCIU project and try to show
             readers how to generate similar results based on functions provided. There are 15 core functions which can be seperated into three groups.
             The first part has 4 functions fmri_time_series, fmri_kimesurface, fmri_image, fmri_ts_forecast.
             They are used to draw the time-series of the fMRI data and forecast or transform time-series data.
             The second part has 7 functions fmri_simulate_func, fmri_stimulus_detect, fmri_2&3dvisual, fmri_pval_comparison_2&3d.
             They are used to simulate the real-valued fMRI data, detect the activated area with p-values as output and visualize the p-values in the brain.
             The final part had 4 functions which is about the laplace transform and kimesurface towards the fMRI data.
