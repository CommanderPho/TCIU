Description: The TCIU package provides the core functionality to transform longitudinal data to
    complex-time (kime) data using analytic and numerical techniques, visualize the original 
    time-series and reconstructed kime-surfaces, perform model based (e.g., tensor-linear regression)
    and model-free classification and clustering methods.The package includes 15 core functions which
    can be separated into three groups. The first group has 4 functions: fmri_time_series, fmri_kimesurface,
    fmri_image, fmri_ts_forecast. These functions are used to draw longitudinal data, such as fMRI time-series,
    and forecast or transform the time-series data. The second group has 7 functions: fmri_simulate_func,
    fmri_stimulus_detect, fmri_2&3dvisual, fmri_pval_comparison_2&3d. These methods are used to simulate
    realistic real-valued time-series data, e.g., fMRI time-courses, detect the activated areas,
    report the corresponding p-values, and visualize the p-values in the 3D brain space. The final group
    had 4 functions: including the Laplace transform and kimesurface reconstructions of the fMRI data.
